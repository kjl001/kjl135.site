			<ul id="volunteer">
				<li>
					In my high school years, I volunteered at a place to tutor elementary and middle school students on math. There, I have
					experienced having to teach younger kids and make sure to keep everything organized. I have also had to try and manage
					the logistics behind the tutoring section, such as the finances and scheduling.
				</li>
				<li>
					During high school, I also joined a Computer Science club and helped fellow students learn about the basics
					of Computer Science. This in turn has also helped me be more familiarized with Computer Science and also with methods
					of being able to learn certain materials efficiently.

					this very website. My experience consists of building a website from scratch and implementing user centered design into my
					site.
				</li>
				<li>
					C, C++: During many classes in university, I have had to work on projects using C and C++. Some of these projects consisted
					of implementing a simple router for sending packets over the internet and a basic ray-tracing algorithm for 3D objects.
				</li>
				<li>
					SQL: I have basic experience in using SQL with creating, editing, and updating databases for a system to be able
